# OCP 5.x Operator Management & OLM — UX prototype

Interactive React/TypeScript prototype for OpenShift Container Platform **5.x** operator catalog, installed operators, and related management flows. Built with **Vite**, **Tailwind CSS v4**, and **React Router v7**.

**Primary tracking:** [HPUX-1480](https://redhat.atlassian.net/browse/HPUX-1480) (Atlassian / Jira).

This repository is the **standalone** home for this work (separate from the cluster-update–only prototype repo). Historical lineage traces to shared UX exploration with `ocp5-cluster-update-experience`; ongoing Operator Management / OLM UX changes land here.

### Problem statement

Cluster Administrators need a centralized, consistent Operator Management experience. Today, fragmented catalog experiences, limited guidance on updates, and suboptimal table density increase cognitive load and slow decision-making.

### Goals

- Centralize Operator discovery/management by moving to a single catalog API.
- Integrate AI-driven update recommendations to reduce update fatigue and risk.
- Optimize Operator Management tables for efficient scanning and decision-making.

### Definition of Done

- Epic scope and success criteria are approved by UX and Console stakeholders.
- All child stories are created, prioritized, and linked to this Epic.
- Cross-team dependencies are identified (Console, catalog API, AI/insights).
- Plan includes validation checkpoints (design reviews, usability/feedback as needed).

### Strategic reminders

- Link this Epic to the relevant **OCPSTRAT** item for Operator Lifecycle / Operator Management so it appears on leadership dashboards.
- Ensure **Fix Version** is set to **5.0**.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** 18+ and **npm** 9+

### Install and run

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:5173/administration/cluster-update](http://localhost:5173/administration/cluster-update) for **Cluster Update**, or [http://localhost:5173/ecosystem/installed-operators](http://localhost:5173/ecosystem/installed-operators) for **Installed Operators**.

### Build for production

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

The production bundle is suitable for static hosting (for example **Vercel**). This repo includes `vercel.json` with SPA rewrites to `index.html`.

## Cluster Update (`/administration/cluster-update`)

Primary surface for exploring update planning, history, and (in prototype form) manual versus agent-driven flows.

### Tabs

- **Update plan** — Channel banner, optional **AI Assessment** (OpenShift Lightspeed pre-check entry point), update method or agent-only layout, and supporting sections depending on mode.
- **Update history** — Past update runs with method, outcome, and timing.

### Prototype demo: experience variant (saved in the browser)

Under the page title, a **segmented control** switches between two demo presentations (choice is stored in `localStorage` under `ocp5-cluster-update-demo-variant`):

| Option | Label in UI | Behavior |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| **Manual + Agent** | Manual + Agent **(OCP 5.1)** | Full **Update Method** picker (Manual vs Agent-based). **AI Assessment** is shown. Manual path includes available versions, operators on the cluster, and worker nodes. Agent path shows the **AI Update Agent** experience. |
| **Agent only** | Agent only **(OCP 5.0)** | **Update Method** is hidden. **AI Assessment** is shown with OCP 5.0–oriented copy. Only the agent-driven update plan experience is shown below it. |

This is for **design and stakeholder demos**, not product configuration.

### Manual update path (when Manual + Agent → Manual)

- Channel selection and **Available updates** (version groups, risk, operator issues).
- **Operators on this cluster** — table with compatibility for the selected target version, filters, and links into operator detail flows.
- **Worker nodes** — pool-level summary for the prototype.

### Agent update path (AI Update Agent)

- **Activity summary** metrics and a **current proposed plan** (version jump, maintenance window, step checklist).
- Plan header shows **Prerequisites** (for example, count of required operator updates) instead of a generic “ready for review” label when the plan is still pending.
- **Decision actions** (when the plan is pending): **Approve Plan** (primary), **Pre-check with AI** (opens Lightspeed with cluster pre-check context), **Reject Plan**, and **Schedule for later** as a **link-style** control.

### OpenShift Lightspeed (OLS)

Contextual AI drawer invoked from multiple entry points (AI Assessment **Pre-check with AI**, agent plan actions, Installed Operators assessment, and agent configuration shortcuts). Responses and actions are **prototype simulations** tied to the page context.

### Related routes

- **Version detail** — `/administration/cluster-update/version/:version` — risk and release-style detail for a chosen version.
- **Pre-flight** — `/administration/cluster-update/preflight` — illustrative pre-flight checklist.
- **In progress** — `/administration/cluster-update/in-progress` — progress-style view during an update.

## Installed Operators (`/ecosystem/installed-operators`)

Catalog operators installed on the cluster, aligned with the **Cluster Update** operator table for column names and styling:

- Operator (name + namespace), Version, Cluster compatibility, Update plan, Support phase, Status, Last updated, Managed namespaces, and optional row actions (kebab).
- **Manage columns** — show or hide data columns; Operator is always shown.
- Legend strip: **Cluster extension (OLM v1 managed)**.
- **AI Assessment** variant for this page with Installed Operators-specific copy and pre-check context.

## Ecosystem (other)

- **Software Catalog** — `/ecosystem/software-catalog`
- **Operator detail, install, update, subscription** — under `/ecosystem/installed-operators/...`
